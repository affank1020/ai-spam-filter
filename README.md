<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![AISpamTool](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9267de05-b66f-433c-b1ae-0f3ee08864cf)

I built this project for an assigment at univerity, where the aim was to design a Naïve Bayes classifier algorithm without using scikit-learn or similar libraries. I used a large database of labelled examples of spam and ham messages/emails to train, test and validate the functionality and accuracy of the model. 

In this repository, you can find the Jupyter notebook, which contains lab notes on the steps I took to build this algorithm. 

Beyond the algorithm, I have also implemented the algorithm within my AI tools website: [myaitools.pythonanywhere.com](myaitools.pythonanywhere.com)

You can try the spam classifier tool on this site.
Bootstrapped with Flask, I built the site as a "hub" for a range of AI projects I wanted to try. With this site, I can easily share tools I've made with others.

To protect against academic malpractice/copyright, I have not included the database for this project in this repository. For alternative databases, you could use some of these:
* https://huggingface.co/datasets/TrainingDataPro/email-spam-classification
* https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cavinlobo/email-classification-dataset

### Built With

* Python
* Flask
* HTML/CSS
